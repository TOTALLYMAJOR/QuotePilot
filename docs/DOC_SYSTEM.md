# Documentation System

Last updated: March 27, 2026

## Purpose
This repository uses a layered canonical documentation model.
Each major topic has one source of truth. Other docs should link to that source instead of duplicating content.

## Canonical Documents
- `README.md`: product overview, architecture snapshot, setup, testing commands, and deployment entry points.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: current operational state only (health, active risks, next actions).
- `DEV_TASKS.md`: prioritized backlog only (open work, grouped by priority).
- `CHANGELOG.md`: historical record of shipped/merged changes.

## Update Triggers
- Code or behavior changes: update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Current-state/risk/near-term execution changes: update `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- Roadmap priority changes: update `DEV_TASKS.md`.
- Setup/process/deploy entrypoint changes: update `README.md`.

## CI Change-Type Enforcement
`scripts/check-doc-governance.mjs` enforces these non-negotiable mappings:

| Change Type | Trigger Examples | Required Canonical Doc Update |
|---|---|---|
| code | `src/`, `functions/`, `e2e/`, runtime behavior files | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| process | `.github/`, `scripts/`, `.codex/skills/`, contributor/agent policy files | one of `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/VERSION_CONTROL.md`, `docs/DOC_SYSTEM.md` |
| deploy | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/*`, deploy workflows/config | one of `README.md`, `docs/LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/VERSION_CONTROL.md`, `docs/DOC_SYSTEM.md` |
| backlog | roadmap/backlog/task artifacts | `DEV_TASKS.md` |

## Data Ownership Matrix
| Topic | Canonical Doc | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime stack versions (React/Vite/Firebase) | `README.md` | Other docs must not restate versions unless they directly link back. |
| Current delivery health and risk posture | `PROJECT_STATUS.md` | Includes what is working now and current blockers. |
| Priority backlog and sequencing | `DEV_TASKS.md` | Open items only; no progress narrative. |
| Historical shipped changes | `CHANGELOG.md` | Immutable history by date/version/merge period. |
| Release workflow/process policy | `docs/VERSION_CONTROL.md` | References this doc for ownership rules. |
| Agent policy and skill governance | `docs/AGENT_GOVERNANCE.md` | `docs/SKILLS.md` remains index-only. |
| Cloud/local orchestration policy and lane contracts | `docs/ORCHESTRATION_BLUEPRINT.md` | Operational commands and scenarios live in `docs/ORCHESTRATION_RUNBOOK.md`. |
| Launch runbook details | `docs/LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md` | `GO_LIVE_OPTION1.md` points here. |
| Staff/admin operating guide | `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` | Task-oriented usage instructions; avoids release/process policy duplication. |
| Performance budgets and CWV policy | `docs/PERFORMANCE_GUARDRAILS.md` | Baselines live under `docs/performance/`. |

## Redundancy Rules
- Do not duplicate full status snapshots across multiple docs.
- Do not duplicate command inventories when one canonical location exists.
- Prefer links to canonical docs instead of copied sections.

## Security Scan Note
Documentation secret scanning blocks real token-like values and allows explicit placeholder values such as `<your_secret_here>`.

## Merge Discipline
Per merge, contributors must review this order:
1. `CHANGELOG.md`
2. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (if state changed)
3. `DEV_TASKS.md` (if priorities changed)
4. `README.md` (if setup/process/deploy entry points changed)

Automated governance checks in CI enforce these rules.
