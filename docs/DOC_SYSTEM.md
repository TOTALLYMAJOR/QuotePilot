# Documentation System

Last updated: August 3, 2026

## Purpose
This repository uses a layered canonical documentation model.
Each major topic has one source of truth. Other docs should link to that source instead of duplicating content.

## Canonical Documents
- `README.md`: product overview, architecture snapshot, setup, testing commands, and deployment entry points.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: current operational state only (health, active risks, next actions).
- `DEV_TASKS.md`: prioritized backlog only (open work, grouped by priority).
- `CHANGELOG.md`: historical record of shipped/merged changes.

## Update Triggers
- Code or behavior changes: update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Current-state/risk/near-term execution changes: update `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- Roadmap priority changes: update `DEV_TASKS.md`.
- Setup/process/deploy entrypoint changes: update `README.md`.

## CI Change-Type Enforcement
`scripts/check-doc-governance.mjs` enforces these non-negotiable mappings:

| Change Type | Trigger Examples | Required Canonical Doc Update |
|---|---|---|
| code | `src/`, `functions/`, `e2e/`, runtime behavior files | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| process | `.github/`, `scripts/`, `.codex/skills/`, contributor/agent policy files | one of `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/VERSION_CONTROL.md`, `docs/DOC_SYSTEM.md` |
| deploy | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/*`, deploy workflows/config | one of `README.md`, `docs/LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/VERSION_CONTROL.md`, `docs/DOC_SYSTEM.md` |
| backlog | roadmap/backlog/task artifacts | `DEV_TASKS.md` |

The GitHub job named `lane:firebase-auth-rules` must invoke the package lane of
the same name. That lane owns both Firestore rule tests and the Firebase-backed
browser smoke, so CI cannot silently omit either half of the authorization
contract.

## Proof-Sensitive Delivery Language
Documentation about customer quote delivery must keep these states separate:
- email-provider configuration is present,
- the provider accepted an exact delivery attempt,
- that acceptance matches the exact current valid portal issuance,
- the provider later reports delivery or bounce, and
- the recipient actually received or viewed the message.

Only the server delivery callable or truthful audited provider reconciliation
may establish `sent`; only a real customer portal visit may establish `viewed`.
Generic staff status writes are never evidence for either state. Provider
acceptance for an invalid or expired portal issuance may be recorded, but must
be described as portal-inactive and `requires_rotation` until guarded rotation
and a separate accepted send establish evidence for the new issuance.

Projection migration or backfill must never be described as creating
`deliveryEvidence` or proving historical acceptance. Legacy projections without
that evidence fail closed and recover through an approved resend or truthful
provider reconciliation. Release docs must also keep local validation, hosted
verification, provider evidence, production deployment, and human acceptance
as separate claims.

## Data Ownership Matrix
| Topic | Canonical Doc | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime stack versions (React/Vite/Firebase) | `README.md` | Other docs must not restate versions unless they directly link back. |
| Current delivery health and risk posture | `PROJECT_STATUS.md` | Includes what is working now and current blockers. |
| Priority backlog and sequencing | `DEV_TASKS.md` | Open items only; no progress narrative. |
| Historical shipped changes | `CHANGELOG.md` | Immutable history by date/version/merge period. |
| Release workflow/process policy | `docs/VERSION_CONTROL.md` | References this doc for ownership rules. |
| Agent policy and skill governance | `docs/AGENT_GOVERNANCE.md` | `docs/SKILLS.md` remains index-only. |
| Cloud/local orchestration policy and lane contracts | `docs/ORCHESTRATION_BLUEPRINT.md` | Operational commands and scenarios live in `docs/ORCHESTRATION_RUNBOOK.md`. |
| Launch runbook details | `docs/LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md` | `GO_LIVE_OPTION1.md` points here. |
| Staff/admin operating guide | `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` | Task-oriented usage instructions; avoids release/process policy duplication. |
| Performance budgets and CWV policy | `docs/PERFORMANCE_GUARDRAILS.md` | Baselines live under `docs/performance/`. |

## Redundancy Rules
- Do not duplicate full status snapshots across multiple docs.
- Do not duplicate command inventories when one canonical location exists.
- Prefer links to canonical docs instead of copied sections.

## Security Scan Note
Documentation secret scanning blocks real token-like values and allows explicit placeholder values such as `<your_secret_here>`.

## Merge Discipline
Per merge, contributors must review this order:
1. `CHANGELOG.md`
2. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (if state changed)
3. `DEV_TASKS.md` (if priorities changed)
4. `README.md` (if setup/process/deploy entry points changed)

Automated governance checks in CI enforce these rules.
